**Comments**

1.) It took me a while to figure out how to properly display Bill Clinton's name. I kept having error and after trying several times to get the text to display with first and last name I was finally able to make it work. A “proud me” moment.

2.) This assignment was a great refresher/learning experience.

3.) I noticed in the commits from the git homework it wasn't necessary to add the file location for where I updated items. I read this after making most of my commits for this homework and some have this included.
